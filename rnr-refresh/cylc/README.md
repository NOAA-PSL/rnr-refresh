# Using Cylc with `rnr-refresh`

## Major Differences Between Cylc 7 and 8
If you were using UFS-RNR, then you are likely accustomed to cylc 7.9.3, but
we have updated to cylc 8.2.1 (as of this writing) and will keep up with newer
versions of cylc as we go forward.  So, here's some major changes that may affect
how you use this software.

"suites" are now called “workflows”.
